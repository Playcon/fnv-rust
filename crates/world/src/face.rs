//! Faces that move: lip sync, blinking and the morphs that carry them out,
//! as the game's `BSFaceGenAnimationData` does it (read from its code; the
//! functions are named by address so each fact can be checked again).
//!
//! - Each head part's `.tri` (`nif::Tri`) holds named morphs. A name means
//!   something only if it is one of the engine's channels ([`channel`]):
//!   16 phonemes, 15 expressions, 17 modifiers (blinks, brows, looks,
//!   squints, head turns) and one custom morph. Others are never used.
//! - Each actor has one set of channel weights ([`FaceAnimation`]); every
//!   frame each part adds `weight × morph` for the morphs it has
//!   ([`FaceMorphs::apply`]), weights only counting when `0 < w ≤ 1`.
//! - A spoken line's `.lip` file ([`crate::lip::Lip`]) becomes a queue of
//!   keys, one every 1/30 s, and the voice is held back so the two line up
//!   ([`FaceAnimation::speak`]).
//! - When no modifier keys are waiting, a blink is queued: a pause of
//!   1.5–4 s, then the lids close and open ([`FaceAnimation::update`]).
//! - Without a `.lip` file the mouth doesn't move at all: the game has no
//!   fallback driven by the sound.
//! - While the actor has someone to look at (its head-track target), the
//!   eyes dart: every so often they settle on a small random offset from
//!   straight ahead that depends on the face's strongest emotion, turning
//!   there at `fTrackSpeed` ([`FaceAnimation::track_eyes`], `0064be40`).
//!   They don't aim at the target itself; the head does that
//!   (`crate::look_ik`).
